This **COVID-19 INDIA TRACKER** provides users the details and information regarding the number of *Confirmed*, *Active*, *Recovered*, and *Deceased* cases of Novel Coronavirus in India. The data and statistics is visualised in the form of graphs, and table containing the number of cases of individual states and union territories.
Furthermore, one can search for a particular state also which will result in the data displayed in tabular form (with cases of all the respective cities and districts). <br/><br/>
There are facilities provided for `About COVID 19`, `FAQs`, and `Suggestions`.<br/><br/>
The data updation is quite frequent, thanks to the API used!
